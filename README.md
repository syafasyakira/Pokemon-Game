# Pokemon-Game
This project is a basic Pokémon Battle Simulation game developed in Java as a final assignment for the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course. The main objective of this project is to implement and demonstrate core OOP principles—encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction—within a fun and engaging context.

The application is structured into multiple classes, including different types of monsters such as FireMonster, IceMonster, WaterMonster, and others, all inheriting from a base Monster class. Each monster has its own unique attributes and behavior, following the principles of inheritance and polymorphism.

The battle system is simulated through Java classes like BattleArena, while player interaction and simple UI elements are handled using MainGUI and PokemonBattleGUI. Other features include saving/loading progress, custom exception handling, and modular action handling via the MonsterActions class.

⚠️ Note: This project is intentionally simple and not fully-featured. It is a console + basic GUI-based application and not intended as a complete or professional game. Certain mechanics and features have been simplified or omitted, as the main purpose was to meet the academic requirement of demonstrating object-oriented design.
